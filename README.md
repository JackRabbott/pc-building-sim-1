### The Random PC Build Generator for PC Building Simulator AKA pc-building-sim-1
#### Made by JackRabbott and the team at RouterRabbit.

#### This is a PHP-based web generator for random competitions between friends, or finding challenging builds for yourself.

Live Demo: http://random.routerrabbit.com/




**URL Options**: ?players=#&mods=# 
######  URL Options are optional, and either one, both, or neither can be set and the game will adjust accordingly.
**Players** = Amount of players in this game, can be any number.
**Mods** = How many modifiers are given to the players.



Case size, Max RAM, Max VRAM, and Modifiers all have their own arrays so you can add, remove, change options, or change likelihood as you see fit. 



"Compliment Daniel's White Vans" simply re-rolls with default settings.



It is recommended to have a timer app of some sort open to keep track of time and establishing a time-limit beforehand but how you play is up to you.



### Here it is in action!
